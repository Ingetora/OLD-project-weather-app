## The problem

The major issue was to arrange multiple items inside of the weather app widget. Second problem was putting responsive image into the background. Was trying to put conditional media queries into select if statement, but this did not work. Alternative solution with replacing background statement with backgroundImage statement worked well. Techniques used: scafford: HTML, styling done with CSS, responsivity was done by Javascript. Data trend processing was done with Chart.js, Javascript library for EDA, exploratory data analysis.
